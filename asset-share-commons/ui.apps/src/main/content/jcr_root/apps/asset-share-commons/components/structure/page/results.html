    This script is used to generate the data required by the search results.

    The specific responsivegrid resources are specifically enumerated to minimize unnecessary rendering.
    The forcing of `foundation/components/parsys` is to reduce the overhead of the responsivegrid component, decreasing load time.

    This script can be overlayed in a custom results's component if different resources require inclusion, however be aware:
    ** The more resources included, the slower each AJAX results load will be **
